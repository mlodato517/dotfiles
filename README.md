Various config files for PC setup

## Vim Plug

This uses vim plug and assumes neovim. Install those first.
Some plugins require other software. The ones I can remember
right now are:

- `fzf`
- `rg`

## Shell

This copies over some FISH specific config files so, if you're not using
FISH, ignore those.

## Terminal

This copies over some Alacritty specific config files so, if you're not using
that, ignore those.

## Brewfile (MacOS)

Install [homebrew-bundle](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-bundle) and run

```sh
brew bundle
```

in the directory with the Brewfile.
